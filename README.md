This plugin allows your site's visitors to search your available holiday or rental properties by availability date, from a convenient widget on your website.

The plugin is powered by [Bookster](https://www.booksterhq.com/), Property Management Software
exclusively for holiday rental owners & managers - where you can attract bookings, take care of guests and manage bookings. It connects your WordPress website to your Bookster account - you'll need to make one to use it. 

The Bookster form allows your site visitors to set a check-in and check-out date, and then perform a search of the availibility directly on Bookster for all properties linked to your subscription.
