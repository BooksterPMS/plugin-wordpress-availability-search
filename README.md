Add a Bookster Cross Property Search Widget for your Bookster Subscription to your posts and pages

== Description ==

If you are a [Bookster](https://www.booksterhq.com/) user with an active Subscription and at least one property, you can use this plugin to add a search form to your pages and posts.

Once you've added your Bookster Subscription ID, the plugin will create a shortcode that then you can add to any of your posts and pages.

The form allows your site visitors to set a check-in and check-out and then perform a search of the availibility directly on Bookster for all properties linked to your subscription.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `bookster-cpsw` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen (**Plugins > Installed Plugins**).

You will find **Bookster CPSW** menu in your WordPress admin screen.
